## Getting started

- You need Node.js to run things the way they are built now
- You need angular cli installed `npm install -g @angular/cli`
- You can install all dependencies with `yarn` or `npm install`
- You can start the front end with `ng serve`. The web page is subsequently located at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
- With `yarn start-server` or `npm run start-server` you can start the back end (in the /server-backend directory). The back end will then be accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
- The pages will reload/update when changes are made.

# Testing
- `ng test`
- `ng e2e`
